## Introduction

Bolt Action is a tabletop wargame that allows players to simulate battles from World War II.
One of the most enjoyable aspects of this hobby is painting the miniatures that represent the soldiers, tanks, and other units on the battlefield.

I'll focus on how to paint Bolt Action US infantry miniatures with the M1941 field jacket.

#### M1941 Field Jacket

> The Jacket, Field, O.D. (also unofficially known as O.D. Cotton Field Jacket, Parsons Jacket, or M1941) is a field jacket that was used by US Army soldiers, most famously during the beginning of World War II.
> In 1941 it started to be phased in as a replacement for the wool four-pocket service coat of World War I, but around 1943 it was replaced in turn by the improved M1943 model.
> Owing to wide adoption, the M1941 is usually recognized as a symbol of the World War II American G.I. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1941_Field_Jacket)

## Getting Started

You'll need a variety of paints, brushes, and other tools to create a realistic and detailed look for your miniatures.
Some recommended brands include `Citadel`, `Vallejo`, and `Army Painter`.

Once you have your materials, it's time to prepare the miniatures for painting.
First, make sure they are clean and free of any debris or mold lines. If necessary, use a hobby knife to trim away any excess plastic or metal.
Then, prime the miniatures with a spray or brush-on primer to create a smooth surface for the paint to adhere to.

## Priming

I usually prime my miniatures with my airbrush, but these were primed using **Rust-Oleum Painter's Touch Flat Grey Primer**.

## Base coating

I usually start by applying `Vallejo - German Camo Medium Brown` to the pants and canteen.
While I wait for it to dry, I start applying `Vallejo - Khaki` to the shirt, gaiters, backpack and any ammo pouches on the miniature.
For the helmet, I apply `Vallejo - US Dark Green` and `Vallejo - Flat Brown` is applied to all the leather straps, boots and the rifle.

Painting skin can be intimidating, but I've found my simplest (and favourite) results start with a base coat of `Citadel - Bugman's Glow`.
Finally, metallic details on the rifle are done with `Citadel - Leadbelcher`.

As I apply the base coats, mistakes are inevitable. Luckily, this is easy to fix by cleaning it up with the base coat for that part of the miniature.

## Shading

To add depth to my miniatures, I start by applying a shade (aka wash).
I'd suggest waiting a few minutes (~10 minutes) for your base coats to dry before applying a wash.

First, I start by applying `Citadel - Nuln Oil` to the rifle and helmet, covering the parts entirely.
For the uniform, boots, backpack and pouches I shade them by applying `Citadel - Agrax Earthshade`.

Finally (and carefully), I apply `Citadel - Reikland Fleshshade` to all the skin on the miniature.

## Layering

Many stop after applying washes, but I like to go a bit further to add a few more details to the miniature to make it "pop".
The shades applied in the previous step need to dry for a few minutes (~10 minutes) before applying the layers in this step.

Start by applying `Vallejo - German Camo Medium Brown` to the raised areas of the pants, avoiding the recesses which have been shaded in the previous step.
`Vallejo - Khaki` can be applied in a similar manner on the shirt, gaiters and backpack.

As for the skin, I've found `Citadel - Cadian Fleshtone` to work the best.
Start by carefully applying it to the raised parts on the face (such as the nose and cheeks) as well as the hands.
Dragging the bristles of the paint brush (almost) horizontally across the fingers helps with keeping it neat and only applying it to the raised parts of the hands.

Finally, apply `Vallejo - US Dark Green` to the raised areas of the helmet, as well as applying `Vallejo - Flat Brown` to the raised areas of the rifle, boots and leather straps.

## Highlighting

The _fun_ part.
I've found highlighting to be much simpler by using a brush dedicated for highlighting, usually a `0` or `00` size brush is my go-to.

Recently, I've started using `Vallejo - Dark Sand` to mix with my base coat colours to use for highlighting.
Depending on the colour, I use a ratio of 2 - 3 parts base coat and 1 part `Vallejo - Dark Sand`.
Mix the two colours on a palette (I love using my `Army Painter Wet Palette`) and remove any excess paint from the brush.

Drag the bristles of the brush horizontally across the edges you'd like to highlight, such as:
- The brim of the helmet.
- The creases on the shirt and pants.
- The edges of the rifle.

For highlighting the metallic areas, I use `Citadel - Runefang Steel`.

## Basing

Almost done!

For my US infantry, I've taken small bits of 0.4mm cork and stuck them to the base of the miniature to achieve the effect of rubble **before** priming the miniature.
Then, I apply some PVA glue to the base and _dunk_ the miniature into a tub of `Army Painter Brown Battleground`.
Once the PVA glue has dried, I apply some PVA glue over the pebbles and then finish it off with some patches of grass using `Army Painter Battlefield Field Grass.`
