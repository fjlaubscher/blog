# Turn 1
The US forces rush forward, utilizing a `M3 half-track` to transport a `medium machine gun team`, a `bazooka team`, and an `engineer squad` to the outskirts of the town.
The half-track is destroyed by an Axis infantry squad carrying a `panzerfaust`, leaving the US forces stranded without transport.

# Turn 2
The US M4 Sherman, named `Burger Town`, drives closer to the destroyed half-track, firing an `HE shell` into the enemy infantry squad and laying down suppressing fire with its hull-mounted `medium machine gun`.
US troops take advantage of the situation, launching a fierce assault on the Axis forces and pushing them back.

# Turn 4
The US forces receive devastating news as their M4 Sherman, named `Burger Town`, is destroyed by an enemy `heavy mortar`.

Axis troops push their way into the outskirts of the town, engaging the US troops in a brutal hand-to-hand battle.

US troops hold their ground for a time, but the Axis troops are determined and manage to overpower them.
